**Agents and Tasks**

- Leagues consist of multiple agents working on assigned tasks
- Tasks are executed according to a defined process flow

**Process Types**

- Sequential Process: Tasks are executed linearly, one after another
- Hierarchical Process: A manager agent coordinates and validates task outcomes

## Key Features

**Output Management**

- Leagues provide structured outputs
- Supports multiple formats including raw strings, JSON, and Pydantic models
- Includes task outputs and token usage metrics

**Memory and Caching**

- Supports short-term, long-term, and entity memory
- Caching capability for storing tool execution results
- Enhances efficiency by reducing redundant task execution

**Execution Control**

- Multiple kickoff methods available:
    - Standard kickoff for sequential execution
    - Kickoff_for_each for individual agent execution
    - Async variations for asynchronous processing

## Configuration Options

- Language settings with customizable defaults
- Configurable maximum requests per minute (RPM)
- Optional callbacks for monitoring task execution
- Planning capabilities with AgentPlanner integration
- Customizable logging and output options

The framework provides extensive flexibility in managing agent collaboration while maintaining efficient task execution and resource utilization.
