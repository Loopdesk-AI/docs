## Process Types

**Sequential Process**

- Executes tasks in a predefined order
- Each task's output serves as context for subsequent tasks
- Follows a systematic progression through the task list

**Hierarchical Process**

- Implements a managerial hierarchy structure
- Requires either a manager_llm or manager_agent
- Manager oversees task execution, planning, and delegation
- Tasks are dynamically allocated based on agent capabilities

**Future Development**
A Consensual Process is planned for future implementation, which will introduce collaborative decision-making among agents

## Key Features

**Task Management**

- Processes ensure efficient task distribution
- Tasks are executed in alignment with predefined strategies
- Enables agents to work as a cohesive unit

**Context Handling**

- Tasks can be customized using the context parameter
- Sequential processes maintain context flow between tasks
- Hierarchical processes include validation and review mechanisms
