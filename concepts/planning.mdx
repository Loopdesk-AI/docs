## Core Functionality

Planning automatically generates step-by-step task plans before each league iteration. An AgentPlanner processes all league information and integrates detailed plans into task descriptions.

## Implementation

**Activation**
The planning feature can be enabled by simply adding `planning=True` to your League configuration.

**LLM Integration**
Planning utilizes ChatOpenAI LLM models for task planning. You have the flexibility to specify which ChatOpenAI LLM model you want to use for the planning process.

## Workflow

1. Before each iteration begins, the league information is processed
2. The AgentPlanner creates detailed step-by-step logic
3. The generated plan gets incorporated into each task's description
4. Tasks are executed according to the planned sequence

This systematic approach ensures that tasks are well-organized and executed efficiently within the framework.
