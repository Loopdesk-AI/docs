## Task Structure

A Task consists of essential attributes:

- **Description**: Clear statement of what needs to be done
- **Expected Output**: Detailed description of the desired outcome
- **Agent Assignment**: Optional specification of which agent handles the task
- **Tools**: Optional list of tools/resources the agent can use

## Execution Methods

Tasks can be executed in two primary ways:

- **Sequential**: Tasks run in defined order
- **Hierarchical**: Tasks are assigned based on agent roles and expertise

## Task Dependencies

Tasks can be interconnected through:

- **Context**: Tasks can use outputs from other tasks as input
- **Asynchronous Execution**: Tasks can run in parallel when needed
- **Dependencies**: Tasks can wait for other tasks' completion before starting

## Output Handling

Task outputs are managed through the TaskOutput class with multiple formats:

- **Raw Output**: Default text-based output
- **JSON Output**: Structured data in JSON format
- **Pydantic Models**: Strongly typed data structures

## Configuration Methods

Tasks can be created in two ways:

- **YAML Configuration**: Recommended approach for cleaner, maintainable task definitions
- **Direct Code Definition**: Alternative method using Python code directly

## Tool Integration

Tasks can be enhanced with:

- **Custom Tools**: Specific tools assigned for particular tasks
- **Tool Override**: Ability to override agent's default tools
- **Multiple Tools**: Support for using multiple tools in a single task

## Task Management

Important management features include:

- **Callbacks**: Functions executed after task completion
- **File Output**: Ability to save results to files
- **Directory Creation**: Automatic creation of output directories
- **Validation**: Built-in mechanisms to ensure task integrity
