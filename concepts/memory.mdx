## Memory Components

**Short-Term Memory**

- Uses RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) technology
- Temporarily stores recent interactions and outcomes
- Enables recall of information relevant to current context

**Long-Term Memory**

- Stores valuable insights from past executions
- Uses SQLite3 for data storage
- Helps agents build and refine knowledge over time

**Entity Memory**

- Captures information about people, places, and concepts
- Uses RAG for storing entity information
- Facilitates deeper understanding of relationships

**Contextual Memory**

- Combines short-term, long-term, and entity memory
- Maintains interaction context
- Ensures coherent responses across tasks

## Implementation Features

**Default Configuration**

- Memory system is disabled by default
- Can be enabled with `memory=True`
- Uses OpenAI embeddings by default, but supports multiple providers

**Storage**

- Short-term memory uses Chroma for RAG
- Long-term memory utilizes SQLite3
- Storage location is platform-specific and customizable

## Key Benefits

**Enhanced Capabilities**

- Adaptive Learning: Leaguess become more efficient over time
- Personalization: Remembers user preferences and past interactions
- Improved Problem-Solving: Makes informed decisions based on past experiences

The system can be further customized with various embedding providers including OpenAI, Ollama, Google AI, Azure OpenAI, Vertex AI, Cohere, HuggingFace, and Watson.
