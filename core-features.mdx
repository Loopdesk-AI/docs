This section delves into the essential features of Loopdesk, providing a detailed overview of the tools you'll use most frequently. Mastering these core functionalities will enable you to create compelling and professional-looking videos.

### Timeline-Based Editing

The timeline is where your video takes shape. Loopdesk offers a flexible and intuitive timeline that supports multiple tracks and a wide range of editing actions.

*   **Multi-Track Timeline**: You can add an unlimited number of tracks for video, audio, images, and text. This allows you to layer different media elements to create complex and dynamic scenes. To add a new track, simply right-click in the timeline area and select "Add Track."
*   **Drag-and-Drop Interface**: Arranging your media is as simple as dragging and dropping clips onto the timeline. You can easily reorder clips, move them between tracks, and adjust their timing with intuitive drag-and-drop controls.
*   **Trimming and Splitting**:
    *   **Trimming**: To shorten a clip, hover over its edge on the timeline until the cursor changes to a resize icon, then click and drag to your desired length.
    *   **Splitting**: To cut a clip into two separate parts, move the playhead (the vertical line indicating the current playback position) to the desired point and click the "Split" icon in the toolbar or press `S` on your keyboard.
*   **Timeline Snapping**: To help you align clips with precision, Loopdesk features timeline snapping. As you move clips, they will automatically snap to the edges of other clips or to the playhead, ensuring seamless transitions.

### Media Management

Efficiently managing your media is key to a smooth editing process. Loopdesk provides a centralized Media Library to store and organize all your assets.

*   **Media Library**: The Media Library is accessible from the sidebar in the editor. It displays all the media you have uploaded. You can switch between a grid and list view for easy browsing.
*   **Uploading Media**: To add new media, click the "Upload" button in the Media Library. You can select multiple files from your computer to upload simultaneously. Supported formats include MP4, WebM for video, JPEG, PNG, GIF for images, and MP3, WAV for audio.
*   **Organizing Assets**: You can create folders within the Media Library to organize your assets by project, date, or any other system that works for you. This makes it easy to find the files you need without searching through a long list of media.

### Video Editing Tools

Loopdesk offers a variety of tools to enhance your video clips. When you select a video clip on the timeline, its properties will appear in the sidebar, allowing you to make adjustments.

*   **Transform Controls**: You can resize, rotate, and reposition your video clips directly on the canvas. Handles will appear around the selected clip, allowing you to drag to scale or rotate. For more precise adjustments, you can enter numerical values in the "Transform" section of the sidebar.
*   **Speed Control**: Adjust the playback speed of your clips to create slow-motion or time-lapse effects. Select a clip, and in the sidebar, you'll find a "Speed" control to increase or decrease the playback rate.
*   **Filters and Effects**: Apply a wide range of visual filters to change the look and feel of your video. From color correction to creative effects, you can browse the filter library in the sidebar and apply them with a single click. You can also adjust the intensity of each filter.
*   **Opacity**: Control the transparency of your video clips to create overlays and blending effects. The opacity slider in the sidebar allows you to make a clip more or less transparent.

### Text and Typography

Add professional-looking text and titles to your videos with Loopdesk's powerful text editor.

*   **Adding Text**: To add text, click on the "Text" tab in the sidebar and choose from a variety of pre-styled text elements or start with a basic text box. Drag your chosen text element onto the timeline.
*   **Rich Text Editor**: When you select a text clip, a rich text editor will appear in the sidebar. You can customize the font, size, color, alignment, and style of your text. Loopdesk supports a wide range of fonts, including Google Fonts.
*   **Text Animations**: Bring your text to life with animations. You can add entrance, exit, and motion animations to make your text more engaging. Choose from a library of presets or customize the animation properties to create a unique effect.
*   **Styling Options**: Further customize your text with options for adding shadows, outlines, and backgrounds. These features help your text stand out against any video background.

### Audio Editing

Great audio is crucial for a high-quality video. Loopdesk provides the tools you need to manage your audio tracks effectively.

*   **Adding Audio**: You can add background music, voiceovers, and sound effects by dragging audio files from your Media Library onto an audio track in the timeline.
*   **Volume Control**: Adjust the volume of each audio clip independently. Select an audio clip, and a volume slider will appear in the sidebar. This allows you to balance the levels of different audio elements.
*   **Audio Fades**: Create smooth audio transitions with fade-in and fade-out effects. You can apply these effects from the audio properties panel in the sidebar.
*   **Waveform Visualization**: The audio tracks on the timeline display a waveform visualization, which helps you identify peaks and lulls in the audio, making it easier to synchronize your audio and video.
