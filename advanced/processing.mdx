## Sequential Processing

Sequential processing executes tasks in a linear, step-by-step fashion where:

- Tasks are completed one after another in a predefined order
- The output from each task becomes the input context for the subsequent task
- Task order is fixed according to the initial task list

## Hierarchical Processing

Hierarchical processing implements a management-based structure where:

- A dedicated manager agent oversees the entire operation
- Tasks are dynamically delegated based on a chain of command
- The manager agent handles task planning, delegation, validation, and oversight

## Key Advantages of Hierarchical Processing

Hierarchical processing is particularly effective for complex projects because it enables:

- **Dynamic Resource Allocation**: The manager can assign tasks based on agent capabilities
- **Quality Control**: Built-in validation and oversight through the manager agent
- **Tool Management**: Precise control over tool availability at the agent level

The main distinction lies in flexibility - while sequential processing follows a rigid, predetermined path, hierarchical processing allows for dynamic task management and oversight through a structured command system.
