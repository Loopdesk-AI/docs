Once you have finished editing your video, Loopdesk makes it easy to export and share your creation.

### Exporting Your Video

The export process renders your project into a final video file that you can download and share.

1.  **Initiate Export**: Click the "Export" button in the top toolbar of the editor.
2.  **Choose Settings**: An export panel will appear, allowing you to configure the output settings for your video.
    *   **Resolution**: Select the desired resolution for your video, such as 720p, 1080p, or 4K.
    *   **Quality**: Choose from presets like "Low," "Medium," or "High" to balance file size and visual quality.
    *   **Format**: Select the video format, typically MP4, which is widely compatible with most devices and platforms.
3.  **Start Rendering**: After confirming your settings, click "Start Export." The rendering process will begin. You can monitor the progress in the export queue.
4.  **Download**: Once the rendering is complete, you will receive a notification, and a download link will be available. You can then save the final video file to your computer.

### Cloud Rendering

For larger or more complex projects, Loopdesk utilizes cloud-based rendering to process your videos efficiently without taxing your computer's resources. This means you can close your browser while the video is rendering, and you will be notified when it's ready.

### Sharing Your Project

Loopdesk also offers features for collaboration and sharing:

*   **Sharing Templates**: You can export your custom templates and share them with other Loopdesk users, allowing for consistent branding and style across a team.
*   **Project Collaboration** (Coming Soon): We are working on features that will allow multiple users to collaborate on the same project in real-time, making it easier for teams to work together on video production.
