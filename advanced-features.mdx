Once you're comfortable with the core functionalities, you can explore Loopdesk's advanced features to add a professional polish to your videos. These tools offer greater creative control and allow for more complex and sophisticated editing.

### Keyframe Animation

Keyframes allow you to animate the properties of a clip over time, creating smooth and dynamic motion graphics. You can animate properties like position, scale, rotation, and opacity.

*   **Adding Keyframes**:
    1.  Select a clip on the timeline that you want to animate.
    2.  In the properties panel in the sidebar, find the property you wish to animate (e.g., "Position").
    3.  Move the playhead to the point in time where you want the animation to start.
    4.  Click the diamond-shaped "Add Keyframe" icon next to the property. This sets the initial state of the animation.
*   **Creating Animation**:
    1.  Move the playhead to a new point in time.
    2.  Change the value of the property (e.g., move the clip to a new position on the canvas). A new keyframe will automatically be added at the new time.
    3.  Loopdesk will automatically interpolate the values between these keyframes, creating a smooth animation.
*   **Managing Keyframes**: You can view and manage keyframes directly on the timeline by expanding the clip's properties. This allows you to adjust the timing of each keyframe with precision.

### Image and Graphics Overlays

Enhance your videos by overlaying images and graphics. This is perfect for adding logos, watermarks, or other visual elements.

*   **Adding Images**: Drag an image from your Media Library onto a video track above your main video clip. The image will appear as an overlay.
*   **Layering System**: The order of the tracks on the timeline determines the layering. Clips on higher tracks will appear in front of clips on lower tracks. You can drag tracks up or down to change the layering order.
*   **Blend Modes**: For more creative compositing, you can use blend modes to change how an overlay interacts with the video layer beneath it. Select the image clip, and in the properties panel, you'll find a "Blend Mode" dropdown with options like "Multiply," "Screen," and "Overlay."
*   **Cropping and Masking**: Loopdesk includes tools for cropping images to a specific aspect ratio or shape. You can also apply masks to create interesting visual effects, such as placing a video inside a shape.

### Captions and Subtitles

Make your videos more accessible and engaging by adding captions and subtitles. Loopdesk provides a dedicated system for creating and styling captions.

*   **Adding Captions**:
    1.  Navigate to the "Captions" tab in the sidebar.
    2.  You can add captions manually by typing the text and setting the start and end times for each caption.
    3.  Alternatively, you can import a caption file (e.g., in JSON format) if you have one prepared.
*   **Styling Captions**: You have full control over the appearance of your captions. The properties panel allows you to customize the font, size, color, background, and position of the subtitles to ensure they are readable and match your video's aesthetic.
*   **Synchronization**: The caption editor is synchronized with the timeline, so you can play your video and adjust the timing of each caption with frame-accurate precision.

### Templates and Presets

Streamline your workflow by using templates and presets for your frequently used effects and layouts.

*   **Project Templates**: If you have a standard format for your videos (e.g., an intro, outro, and specific branding), you can save your entire project as a template. When you start a new project, you can begin from your saved template, saving you valuable setup time.
*   **Effect Presets**: You can save custom combinations of filters, animations, and other effects as presets. This allows you to quickly apply a consistent look and feel across different clips or projects.
*   **Sticker and Animation Library**: Loopdesk includes a library of pre-built animated stickers and motion graphics templates. You can browse this library in the sidebar and drag these elements directly onto your timeline to add a fun and professional touch to your videos.
