If you encounter any issues while using Loopdesk, here are some common problems and their solutions.

*   **Choppy Playback in the Editor**:
    *   The live preview in the editor is optimized for speed to allow for smooth editing. If playback appears choppy, this is likely not an issue with your video itself but rather a performance limitation of real-time rendering in the browser. The final exported video will be smooth.
    *   **Solution**: Try lowering the preview quality in the canvas settings or closing other browser tabs and applications to free up system resources.

*   **Media Upload Fails**:
    *   **Solution**: First, check that your internet connection is stable. Ensure the file format you are trying to upload is supported (e.g., MP4, PNG, MP3). If the file is very large, the upload may time out on a slow connection. Try uploading smaller files or compressing the media before uploading.

*   **Export Fails or Gets Stuck**:
    *   **Solution**: This can sometimes happen with very complex projects. Try clearing your browser cache and attempting the export again. If it continues to fail, try exporting at a slightly lower resolution or quality setting. Also, ensure you have enough available storage space on your device for the downloaded file.

*   **General Issues or Unexpected Behavior**:
    *   **Solution**: Many common issues can be resolved by performing a hard refresh of the page (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R) or clearing your browser's cache and cookies. If the problem persists, try using Loopdesk in a different supported browser to see if the issue is browser-specific.
