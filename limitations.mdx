While Loopdesk is a powerful and versatile video editor, there are a few limitations to be aware of to ensure the best possible experience.

*   **Browser Compatibility**: Loopdesk is optimized for modern web browsers such as Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, and Microsoft Edge. For the best performance and stability, please ensure your browser is up-to-date. Using older or unsupported browsers may result in unexpected behavior or reduced functionality.
*   **Internet Connection**: As a web-based platform, Loopdesk requires a stable internet connection for loading projects, uploading media, and saving your progress. A slow or intermittent connection may affect performance, especially when working with large files.
*   **Performance on Complex Projects**: While the editor is highly optimized, extremely complex projects with many layers, high-resolution videos, and numerous effects may experience performance issues on lower-end computers. The real-time preview in the editor is designed to be responsive, which may result in a slightly lower quality than the final exported video. The final render will always be at the full quality you select.
*   **Upload File Size**: There may be limits on the size of individual files you can upload. If you encounter issues when uploading very large video files, consider compressing them to a smaller size before importing them into the Media Library.
